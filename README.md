# <strong>Sentiment Analysis using RoBERTa (transformer model) </strong> 
This notebook aims to build and deploy a transformer model to conduct sentiment analysis on Reddit comments 
to interpret Reddit user's perception towards the two main political parties in the US.<br>

Paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590005622000224

<br>

# <strong>Approach</strong>
1. Conducted investigative research on relevant ML technologies to scope feasibility of project and settled on transformer based models given their precision. 
2. Obtained relevant preprepared data sets from Kaggle  
3. Conducted preliminary data analysis and conducted data cleaning for training and validation. 
4. RoBERTa model built. 
<br>

# <strong>To Do</strong>
1. Optimise dataset further to reduce its dimensionality. Presently program will run but compute time is exponential on present hardware.
2. Further improvements to be made to model as identified according by paper Janin et.al (2020) 
<br>
